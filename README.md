# Soccer Coordinator

You have volunteered to be the coordinator for your town’s youth soccer league. As part of your job you need to divide the 18 children who have signed up for the league into three even teams — Dragons, Sharks, and Raptors. In years past, the teams have been unevenly matched, so this year you are doing your best to fix that. For each child, you will have the following information:

- Name,
- Height (in inches),
- Whether or not they have played soccer before, and
-  Their guardians’ names.
